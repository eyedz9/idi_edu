Two years later, I walked into my first client meeting with a portfolio that got me hired on the spot. IDI didn't just teach me design — it gave me a second career I'm obsessed with.",

But the graduate seminars cracked open my thinking in ways I didn't expect. The thesis process forced me to articulate why I design the way I do. Now I run my own firm and I teach part-time at IDI, which feels like the most natural full circle.",
